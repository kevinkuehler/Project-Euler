# Project-Euler

Solutions are in C++ and, at a minimum, run in C++11. All files run on their own (no class dependencies). I chose to do this because I assume most vistors will look to reference runnable code for a specific problem, and my aim is to make that as easy as possible. Let me know if you would prefer a library class.
